### Prehackathon planning
**Project**
TikTok for video games
Imagine webpage with white box in middle (game zone)
you can scroll up and it will show next generated game (will need to pregenerate the next game)

We use dev server on freestyle.sh
We use morph llm to make quick apply edits to the game page



**Attack Plan**
NOTES FOR CURSOR: when you are done with each step, stop and let me, the human, test before proceeding
1. make a repo that has a basic webpage with: (scroll calls a function that prints hello world), big white space in the middle of screen that is a seperate component that is easily editable by code,



our P0 will not have any quick cache for the next game item
